<h1>Setters</h1>
<p>Along with getter methods, we can also create setter methods which reassign values of existing properties within an object. </p>

<p>Setter methods like <code>numOfSensors</code> do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like weâ€™re reassigning the value of a property.</p>

<p>Like getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties.</p>
